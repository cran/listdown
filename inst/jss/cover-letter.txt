Dear Editors,

Please find the attached submission, "On the Programmatic Generation of Reproducible 
Documents," which explores the use and appropriateness of programmatically generating 
reproducible documents, identifies key concepts for understanding their use, and introduces a 
new R package, listdown, that implements the generation of R Markdown documents, and 
explores it's use in a clinical trial reporting context.

We believe this paper provides a novel take on the relationship between reproducibility and 
automated reporting, and we expect that this article will see broad readership in this 
increasingly popular area of statistics and data science.

The package's interface is now stable and the associated code is available on CRAN, it is being 
actively maintained, and it is also being used regularly.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and neither of the authors have a conflict of 
interest to declare.

Sincerely,

Michael Kane and Simon Urbanek
